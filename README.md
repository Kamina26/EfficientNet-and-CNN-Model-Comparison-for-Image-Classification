# EfficientNet and CNN Model Comparison for Image Classification

This project focuses on comparing the performance of various CNN architectures, including EfficientNet, Inception, NASNet, ResNet, and MobileNet, for large-scale image classification tasks. The models are sourced from TensorFlow Hub and are pre-trained on the ImageNet and ImageNet21K datasets. The project explores their feature extraction capabilities and evaluates their performance on standard image classification tasks.

- **EfficientNet** (B0, B1, B2, B3, and V2 variants) - Pre-trained on ImageNet and ImageNet21K
- **Inception V3**, **Inception ResNet V2** - Pre-trained on ImageNet
- **NASNet Large**, **PNASNet Large** - Pre-trained on ImageNet
- **ResNet V1 (50, 101, 152)**, **ResNet V2 (50, 101, 152)** - Pre-trained on ImageNet
- **MobileNet V2 & V3** - Pre-trained on ImageNet

## Key Features

- Utilizes TensorFlow Hub for easy model integration.
- Comparisons based on feature extraction from pre-trained models.
- Detailed analysis of model performance on standard image classification datasets.
